  1. Importing Libraries and Setting Up
- This block imports the necessary libraries for data manipulation (`pandas`), model training and evaluation (`scikit-learn`), tokenization (`nltk`), spelling correction (`pyspellchecker`), and visualization (`matplotlib`, `seaborn`).
- `Word2Vec` from `gensim` is used for word embedding.
- `nltk.download('punkt')` ensures the necessary data for tokenization is available.

  2. Loading and Splitting the Data
- This block reads the dataset into a `pandas` DataFrame.
- `X` and `y` are defined as the features and labels respectively.
- The data is split into training, validation, and test sets (70% training, 15% validation, and 15% test).

  3. Word2Vec Vectorization
- `tokenize_text`: Tokenizes the text into words.
- Tokenizes the training, validation, and test sets.
- Trains a Word2Vec model on the training data.
- `get_average_word2vec`: Computes the average Word2Vec vector for a list of tokens.
- Applies this function to the tokenized data to get the Word2Vec representations.

  4. Computing and Combining Features
- `compute_text_length`: Computes the length of each text entry.
- Computes text lengths for the training, validation, and test sets.
- Combines the Word2Vec vectors with text lengths to form the final feature sets.

  5. Training a Random Forest Classifier
- Initializes a Random Forest classifier with 100 trees.
- Trains the classifier on the combined training data.

  6. Model Evaluation
- Predicts labels for the test set.
- Calculates and prints the test accuracy.
- Generates and prints a classification report.
- Generates and prints a confusion matrix.

  7. Confusion Matrix Visualization

- Visualizes the confusion matrix using a heatmap for better understanding.

  8. Adding Misspelled Words Feature
- Initializes the spell checker.
- `count_misspelled_words`: Counts the number of misspelled words in a text.
- Computes the number of misspelled words for the training, validation, and test sets.
- Combines the Word2Vec vectors, text lengths, and misspelled word counts to form the final feature sets.

  9. Retraining the Random Forest Classifier
- Reinitializes and retrains the Random Forest classifier with the new combined feature set.

  10. Reevaluating the Model

- Predicts labels for the test set with the new model.
- Calculates and prints the test accuracy.
- Generates and prints a classification report.
- Generates and prints a confusion matrix.

  11. Confusion Matrix Visualization (Repeated)

- Visualizes the confusion matrix using a heatmap again for the updated model.

  12. Hyperparameter Tuning

- Defines the hyperparameter distribution for Random Forest.
- Performs randomized search with cross-validation to find the best hyperparameters.
- Prints the best parameters and the best cross-validation score.

  13. Training with Best Parameters

- Trains the Random Forest classifier with the best-found hyperparameters.

  14. Final Model Evaluation

- Predicts labels for the validation set and calculates validation accuracy.
- Predicts labels for the test set and calculates test accuracy.
- Generates and prints a classification report.
- Generates and prints a confusion matrix.
- Visualizes the confusion matrix using a heatmap.

  15. ROC Curve and AUC Score

- Predicts probabilities for the test set.
- Calculates the False Positive Rate (FPR), True Positive Rate (TPR), and thresholds for the ROC curve.
- Calculates the Area Under the Curve (AUC) score.
- Plots the ROC curve.
- Prints the AUC score.
