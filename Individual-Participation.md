| Paulina Gonzalez | ML Technique 2: SVM                    | Added cross-validation, implemented learning curve of training and cross-validation to check for overfitting. Also, added regularization c parameter to reduce overfitting and change code to use new dataset. |
| Jheel Shah       | Data Preprocessing                     | Initial Dataset Examination; Coordinating Preprocessing Start Points with teammates; TF-IDF vectorization and model training; Bag of Words vectorization and model training using the new updated training, validation and testing datasets; Provided teammates with the updated code for further implementation of ML models|
| Jharna Kumari    | Data Augumentation                     | Uvic dataset and Kaggle Normal Email dataset Augment. Collaborate with teammate to work on the same on colab. Downsample normal emails dataset. Split data into training, validation and test sets before feature extraction. Explore about PCA for dimensionality reduction. Removed Stopwords from the dataset in the cleaning process. Supplied training, validation and testing datasets to teammates resulting in increased accuracy. Implemented PCA but that led to decreased accuracy for ML models. |

| Adel Agha        | ML Technique 3: Random Forest          | Random Forest Classifier Research, Optimization and tuning parameters(Depth and Nestimators) for best performance. Attempting different feature extraction techniques like OneHot and TF-IDF Vectorization. Exploring BERT, a neural network technique                          |
| Zixin Li         | ML Technique 1: Logistic Regression    | Logistic Regression Research, Logistic Regression Optimization, Logistic Regression Cross Validation                                                          |
| Summer Liu       | ML Technique 2: SVM                    | Implemented linear-SVM, tried different vectorizer and compared two results |                    
| Birva Patel      | ML Technique 3: Random Forest          | Random Forest Provided an overview,Optimized and developed Random Forest classifier using Scikit-Learn,integrated into project pipeline  |
