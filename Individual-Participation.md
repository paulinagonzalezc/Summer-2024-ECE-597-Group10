## Contributions of Zixin Li

- **Logistic Regression Optimization**
  - Implemented logistic regression optimization code to find the best threshold for classification.
  - Utilized metrics such as F1 score, precision, recall, and balanced accuracy to evaluate model performance at different thresholds.
  - Identified the best threshold that maximizes the F1 score, and evaluated the model using the best threshold, calculating the AUC score, confusion matrix, and balanced accuracy score.


- **Results Analysis**
  - Analyzed the confusion matrix at the best threshold to understand the model's performance in terms of TP, TN, FP, and FN.
  - Discussed the importance of balanced accuracy in evaluating the model on imbalanced datasets.

- **Visualization**
  - Designed a plot to visualize the metrics versus thresholds, providing insights into how the model's performance varies with different decision thresholds.
